      "question": "The following text is adapted from Nathaniel Hawthorne\u2019s 1837 story \u201cDr. Heidegger\u2019s Experiment.\u201d The main character, a physician, is experimenting with rehydrating a dried flower.\n\nAt first [the rose] lay lightly on the surface of the fluid, appearing to imbibe none of its moisture. Soon, however, a singular change began to be visible. The crushed and dried petals stirred and assumed a deepening tinge of crimson, as if the flower were reviving from a deathlike slumber.\n\nAs used in the text, what does the phrase \u201ca singular\u201d most nearly mean?",
      "answers": [
        "A. A lonely",
        "B. A disagreeable",
        "C. An acceptable",
        "D. An extraordinary"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "rationale": "Choice D is the best answer because as used in the text, \u201csingular\u201d most nearly means extraordinary. The text portrays an experiment in which a character rehydrates a dried rose by infusing it with moisture. After prolonged contact with the liquid, the rose begins to absorb it, undergoing an exceptional transformation: its color deepens, its previously \u201ccrushed and dried\u201d petals shift, and the entire flower revives \u201cfrom a deathlike slumber.\u201d In other words, an extraordinary change is visible in the flower.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. Although in some contexts \u201csingular\u201d can mean of or relating to an individual or to a single instance of something, this usage doesn\u2019t imply loneliness or an otherwise unsatisfactory condition of isolation. Moreover, the text doesn\u2019t attribute such a condition to the rose. Choice B is incorrect. Although \u201csingular\u201d has several related meanings, none of them relate to being disagreeable or unpleasant. Moreover, the text doesn\u2019t portray the change undergone by the rose as necessarily disagreeable. Choice C is incorrect because \u201csingular\u201d means extraordinary, not acceptable. The change is portrayed as striking, not barely satisfactory."

      "question": "Rejecting the premise that the literary magazine *Ebony and Topaz* (1927) should present a unified vision of Black American identity, editor Charles S. Johnson fostered his contributors\u2019 diverse perspectives by promoting their authorial autonomy. Johnson\u2019s self-effacement diverged from the editorial stances of W.E.B. Du Bois and Alain Locke, whose decisions for their publications were more ______.\n\nWhich choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",
      "answers": [
        "A. proficient",
        "B. dogmatic",
        "C. ambiguous",
        "D. unpretentious"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "rationale": "Choice B is the best answer. A person who is 'dogmatic' believes strongly that their principles and opinions are true. Because Du Bois and Locke are implied to have one 'unified vision' of Black American identity that they prioritize over the 'diverse perspectives' of different writers, they can be described as dogmatic.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. 'Proficient' means 'skilled.' Du Bois and Locke are contrasted with Johnson, but nothing in the text suggests that Johnson was not skilled at making editorial decisions. Based on the text, the three editors just have different styles; they're not necessarily more or less skilled. Choice C is incorrect. 'Ambiguous' means 'unclear' or 'open to multiple interpretations.' However, it's actually Johnson who encouraged multiple interpretations ('diverse perspectives'). Since Du Bois and Locke are said to 'diverge' from Johnson, we can assume that the views they published were not ambiguous, but instead clear and firm (a 'unified vision'). Choice D is incorrect. 'Unpretentious' means 'not trying to impress others with greater skill or importance than is actually possessed.' Du Bois and Locke are contrasted with Johnson, but nothing in the text suggests that Johnson is pretentious (trying to impress others)."

      "question": "\u201cHow lifelike are they?\u201d Many computer animators prioritize this question as they strive to create ever more realistic environments and lighting. Generally, while characters in computer-animated films appear highly exaggerated, environments and lighting are carefully engineered to mimic reality. But some animators, such as Pixar\u2019s Sanjay Patel, are focused on a different question. Rather than asking first whether the environments and lighting they\u2019re creating are convincingly lifelike, Patel and others are asking whether these elements reflect their films\u2019 unique stories.\n\nWhich choice best describes the function of the underlined question in the text as a whole?",
      "answers": [
        "A. It reflects a primary goal that many computer animators have for certain components of the animations they produce.",
        "B. It represents a concern of computer animators who are more interested in creating unique backgrounds and lighting effects than realistic ones.",
        "C. It conveys the uncertainty among many computer animators about how to create realistic animations using current technology.",
        "D. It illustrates a reaction that audiences typically have to the appearance of characters created by computer animators."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "rationale": "Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately describes the function of the underlined question in the text as a whole. The text begins with the underlined question, \u201cHow lifelike are they?\u201d The text then explains that many computer animators pose this question about the environments and lighting that they create for animated films, striving for realistic animation of those components even if the characters themselves aren\u2019t portrayed in realistic terms. The focus of the text then shifts to describe how some animators strive to create environments and lighting that reflect the film\u2019s unique stories rather than making them appear realistic. Therefore, the function of the underlined question is to reflect a primary goal that many computer animators have for certain components of the animations they produce.\n\nChoice B is incorrect because, as the text makes clear, the underlined question is one posed by computer animators who wish to create realistic backgrounds and lighting effects, not by those who, instead, wish to create effects that reflect films\u2019 unique stories and aren\u2019t necessarily realistic; this latter group of animators is discussed later in the text. Choice C is incorrect. As the text explains, many computer animators strive for realistic environments and lighting, while others do not; this difference of approach relates to whether these components should be realistic, not to how realism can be achieved using current technology, and the text never suggests that animators are uncertain how to achieve it. Choice D is incorrect because the underlined question pertains to the perspective of computer animators, not the audience, and the text never considers audience\u2019s reactions to characters in animated films."

      "question": "The field of study called affective neuroscience seeks instinctive, physiological causes for feelings such as pleasure or displeasure. Because these sensations are linked to a chemical component (for example, the release of the neurotransmitter dopamine in the brain when one receives or expects a reward), they can be said to have a partly physiological basis. These processes have been described in mammals, but Jingnan Huang and his colleagues have recently observed that some behaviors of honeybees (such as foraging) are also motivated by a dopamine-based signaling process.\n\nWhat choice best describes the main purpose of the text?",
      "answers": [
        "A. It describes an experimental method of measuring the strength of physiological responses in humans.",
        "B. It illustrates processes by which certain insects can express how they are feeling.",
        "C. It summarizes a finding suggesting that some mechanisms in the brains of certain insects resemble mechanisms in mammalian brains.",
        "D. It presents research showing that certain insects and mammals behave similarly when there is a possibility of a reward for their actions."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "rationale": "Choice C is the best answer because it most accurately describes the main purpose of the text, which is to summarize a finding suggesting that some mechanisms in the brains of certain insects resemble mechanisms in mammalian brains. The text begins by explaining that feelings such as pleasure and displeasure are linked to chemical processes in the brain, such as the release of dopamine when one receives a reward. The text then indicates that such processes have been seen in mammals but that researchers have recently observed similar processes involving dopamine in honeybees. Taken together, this information serves to sum up the discovery that some mechanisms in the brains of certain insects may resemble mechanisms linked to feelings such as pleasure and displeasure in mammals.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t describe any experiments or experimental methods. Instead, the text describes a phenomenon that has been observed in mammals and then presents the recent observations of Huang and colleagues that this phenomenon is also seen in honeybees. Choice B is incorrect because there\u2019s nothing in the text to suggest that certain insects can express how they\u2019re feeling through particular processes. The text does indicate that certain honeybee behaviors such as foraging are linked to dopamine, but it doesn\u2019t suggest that these behaviors enable honeybees to communicate feelings or sensations. Choice D is incorrect because the text presents research showing that certain honeybee behaviors such as foraging are linked to dopamine and therefore may be motivated by similar mechanisms to those in mammalian brains, not that honeybees and mammals behave similarly when there is the possibility of reward for their actions."

      "question": "Drivers who strongly believe that the toll they must pay to use the Lewis and Clark Bridge, which spans the Ohio River to connect Indiana and Kentucky, is currently too high are unlikely to be ______ a proposal to increase the toll. Advocates for a higher toll are likely to have more success if they instead direct their arguments toward a more persuadable segment of the population.\n\nWhich choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",
      "answers": [
        "A. receptive to",
        "B. apprised of",
        "C. incensed by",
        "D. cited in"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "rationale": "Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of driver attitudes toward a toll increase. In this context, \u201creceptive to\u201d would mean open to or willing to consider something. The text focuses on drivers who think the current toll for the Lewis and Clark Bridge is too high, suggesting that advocates for increasing that toll would have better success presenting their arguments to \u201ca more persuadable segment of the population\u201d rather than to those drivers. This context suggests that the drivers who strongly believe the toll is already too high are not persuadable\u2014that is, that they are unlikely to be willing to consider the toll-increase proposal.\n\nChoice B is incorrect because \u201capprised of\u201d means informed about or made aware of something, and nothing in the text suggests that the drivers who think a toll is already too high wouldn\u2019t be informed of a proposal for an even higher toll; in fact, the text implies that advocates of the proposal would \u201cdirect their arguments\u201d in favor of the increase to those drivers, even though they would likely be more successful focusing on people who are more open to hearing their arguments. Choice C is incorrect. In this context, \u201cincensed by\u201d would mean angered or outraged by something. The text focuses on drivers who feel that a current toll is too high, and it wouldn\u2019t make sense to suggest that those drivers would be _unlikely_ to be angered by a proposal for the toll to be increased; indeed, drivers who think the toll is already too high likely would be angered by a move to raise it even higher. Choice D is incorrect. In this context, \u201ccited in\u201d would mean referred to or mentioned in something. Although it\u2019s reasonable to suggest that a proposal to raise a toll might not make any mention of drivers who think the toll is already too high, the text focuses on how those drivers and other people are likely to react to arguments in favor of the proposal, not on whether those drivers would be cited in the proposal itself."

      "question": "According to a team of neuroeconomists from the University of Zurich, ease of decision making may be linked to communication between two brain regions, the prefrontal cortex and the parietal cortex. Individuals tend to be more decisive if the information flow between the regions is intensified, whereas they make choices more slowly when information flow is ______.\n\nWhich choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",
      "answers": [
        "A. reduced",
        "B. evaluated",
        "C. determined",
        "D. acquired"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "rationale": "Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of how the flow of information between two regions of the brain may affect the ease of people\u2019s decision making. In this context, 'reduced' means decreased. The text presents the finding from a team of neuroeconomists that decision making may be connected to communication between the prefrontal cortex and the parietal cortex. In presenting this finding, the text suggests a contrast between people who tend to be more decisive and people who make decisions more slowly. According to the text, people tend to be more decisive when the flow of information between the two brain regions is intensified, or strengthened. On the other hand, this context suggests that people make choices more slowly when the flow of information between the two brain regions is decreased.\n\nChoice B is incorrect because 'evaluated' means assessed, which wouldn\u2019t make sense in context. According to the text, people tend to be more decisive when the flow of information between two brain regions is intensified, or strengthened. This suggests that people\u2019s ease of decision making varies based on the rate of information traveling between the regions, not based on an effort to assess the information. Choice C is incorrect because 'determined' means judged or influenced, neither of which would make sense in context. According to the text, people tend to be more decisive when the flow of information between two brain regions is intensified, or strengthened. This suggests that people\u2019s ease of decision making varies based on the rate of information traveling between the regions, not based on an effort to judge or influence the information. Choice D is incorrect because 'acquired' means developed or attained, neither of which would make sense in context. According to the text, people tend to be more decisive when the flow of information between two brain regions is intensified, or strengthened. This suggests that people\u2019s ease of decision making varies based on the rate of information traveling between the regions, not based on the development or attainment of the information."

      "question": "Some economic historians ______ that late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century households in the United States experienced an economy of scale when it came to food purchases\u2014they assumed that large households spent less on food per person than did small households. Economist Trevon Logan showed, however, that a close look at the available data disproves this supposition.\n\nWhich choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",
      "answers": [
        "A. surmised",
        "B. contrived",
        "C. questioned",
        "D. regretted"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "rationale": "Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century household food purchases. In this context, \u201csurmised\u201d means formed an idea or assumption with little evidence. The text explains that certain economic historians \u201cassumed\u201d that large and small households spent different amounts on food per person, but that another economist found this supposition to be false based on evidence from available data. This context suggests that the economic historians made an incorrect assumption without enough consideration of evidence.\n\nChoice B is incorrect. In this context, \u201ccontrived\u201d would mean brought about or created through trickery. Nothing in the text suggests that the economic historians were deliberately trying to trick people with a claim about food purchasing behaviors in late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century households; the text simply suggests that they made an assumption about those behaviors that another historian believes isn\u2019t supported by the available data. Choice C is incorrect because the text indicates that it\u2019s Logan and not the economic historians who \u201cquestioned,\u201d or doubted, the assumption that large and small households in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries spent different amounts on food per person; the economic historians are the ones who made that assumption to begin with. Choice D is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that some economic historians \u201cregretted,\u201d or felt sad or remorseful about, the food purchasing behaviors of late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century households. The text focuses on the idea that the economic historians made an assumption about those behaviors that may not be supported by available data, not on the historians\u2019 emotional response to what households did in the past."

      "question": "Economist Marco Castillo and colleagues showed that nuisance costs\u2014the time and effort people must spend to make donations\u2014reduce charitable giving. Charities can mitigate this effect by compensating donors for nuisance costs, but those costs, though variable, are largely ______ donation size, so charities that compensate donors will likely favor attracting a few large donors over many small donors.\n\nWhich choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",
      "answers": [
        "A. supplemental to",
        "B. predictive of",
        "C. independent of",

      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "rationale": "Choice C is the best answer. We\u2019re told that charities that pay donors back for nuisance costs will attract a few large donors instead of many small donors. This suggests that nuisance costs are not linked to donation size.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. This doesn\u2019t fit the logic of the text. If nuisance costs are supplemental to (meaning in addition to) donation size, that wouldn\u2019t result in charities that compensate donors for those costs attracting a few large donors over many small donors. Choice B is incorrect. This doesn\u2019t fit the logic of the text. If nuisance costs can predict donation size, that wouldn\u2019t necessarily result in charities that compensate donors for those costs attracting a few large donors over many small donors. Choice D is incorrect. This doesn\u2019t fit the logic of the text. If nuisance costs are subsumed in (meaning included in) donation size, that wouldn\u2019t result in charities that compensate donors for those costs attracting a few large donors over many small donors."

To ______ this situation, Maggie Lena Walker chartered the St. Luke Penny Savings Bank in 1903. The bank went on to provide home loans and savings opportunities to thousands of Black families over the following decades.\n\nWhich choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",

        "C. retain",
        "D. highlight"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "rationale": "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of how Maggie Lena Walker addressed the lack of financial services available to Black residents in Richmond, Virginia, at the turn of the twentieth century. In this context, \u201crectify\u201d means to correct or remedy something undesirable. The text indicates that by chartering the St. Luke Penny Savings Bank in 1903, Walker took action to provide local Black residents with greater access to financial services like home loans and savings opportunities. This context supports the idea that she aimed to rectify the undesirable situation affecting these residents.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because in this context, \u201cprolong\u201d would mean to lengthen something in time. The text indicates that at the turn of the twentieth century, Black residents in Richmond, Virginia, were faced with a lack of formal banking options. The text then states that Walker founded a new bank that provided these residents with financial services. Therefore, instead of prolonging the situation, she took steps to rectify, or correct, it. Choice C is incorrect because in this context, \u201cretain\u201d would mean to continue to have or to keep something. According to the text, at the turn of the twentieth century, Black residents in Richmond, Virginia, had few formal banking options, and Walker chartered a new institution to provide these residents with expanded financial services; therefore, she took steps to rectify, not retain, the situation. Choice D is incorrect because in this context, \u201chighlight\u201d would mean to emphasize or call attention to something, but the text indicates that Walker took concrete steps beyond merely drawing attention to the situation Black residents were facing in Richmond, Virginia, at the turn of the twentieth century. According to the text, Walker worked to rectify, or correct, the lack of formal banking options that were available to these residents by establishing a bank that provided them with home loans and savings opportunities."

      "question": "During a 2014 archaeological dig in Spain, Vicente Lull and his team uncovered the skeleton of a woman from El Algar, an Early Bronze Age society, buried with valuable objects signaling a high position of power. This finding may persuade researchers who have argued that Bronze Age societies were ruled by men to ______ that women may have also held leadership roles.\n\nWhich choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "rationale": "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of the significance of the 2014 archaeological finding at El Algar. In this context, \u201cconcede\u201d means to admit something is true after first resisting that admission. The text indicates that some researchers believe \u201cBronze Age societies were ruled by men.\u201d But the Bronze Age burial of a woman at El Algar included \u201cvaluable objects signaling a high position of power,\u201d which would raise the possibility that \u201cwomen may have also held leadership roles.\u201d Thus, the text is calling into question the notion that only men were leaders in these societies and speculating that people holding this view may reconsider their opinion.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because \u201cwaive\u201d means to refrain from insisting that something, such as a right or a requirement, be observed; the word isn\u2019t used, however, in contexts where someone acknowledges that an opinion they hold may be invalid, as is the case in the text. Choice C is incorrect. According to the text, the finding from the El Algar burial site undermines the view that Bronze Age societies were exclusively ruled by men. However, \u201crefute\u201d means to demonstrate that something is false and would not make sense in context. Lull and team\u2019s finding supports the view that women may have also held leadership roles, not that they did not participate in such roles. Choice D is incorrect because in this context, \u201crequire\u201d means to demand or specify as mandatory. However, it would not make sense for contemporary researchers to demand that Bronze Age \u201cwomen may have also held leadership roles.\u201d"

In this context, \u201coptimize\u201d means make the most effective possible use of available opportunities. The text indicates that though businesses typically try to promote themselves, they don\u2019t always make use of effective tools for doing so, pointing to research showing that 33 percent of restaurants failed to use a free listing service that increased revenue by 5 percent on average for restaurants that did use the service. The text therefore suggests that by foregoing a free and effective marketing tool, some businesses aren\u2019t making the best use of, or optimizing, marketing opportunities.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because in this context, \u201cadorn\u201d would mean decorate or enhance the appearance of, and there\u2019s nothing in the text to suggest that by failing to use a free and effective promotional tool, some businesses aren\u2019t enhancing the appearance of their own marketing. The example in the text illustrates that some businesses aren\u2019t utilizing an effective marketing opportunity, not that they aren\u2019t improving the appearance of their marketing. Choice C is incorrect because in this context, \u201cendorse\u201d would mean openly approve or recommend, and the text\u2019s discussion of the fact that some businesses have overlooked an effective marketing tool doesn\u2019t support the idea that those businesses therefore don\u2019t approve of their own marketing. Choice D is incorrect because in this context, saying that businesses don\u2019t \u201ccounteract\u201d their marketing would suggest that they don\u2019t actively undermine it or make it ineffective. The text begins by stating that businesses typically try to promote themselves but then continues to imply that some businesses fail to take advantage of good opportunities to do so, citing the example of businesses that failed to use a free and effective marketing tool. Though it\u2019s possible that those businesses that did use the site therefore didn\u2019t unintentionally counteract their own marketing, the first sentence conveys that the text\u2019s focus is on things that some businesses do and that some businesses don\u2019t do when trying to promote themselves, and it wouldn\u2019t make sense to say that any businesses would actively try to undermine their own marketing in pursuit of that goal."

In this context, 'corroborate' means confirm or support with evidence.

This means that practitioners may assume that an outcome is the direct result of a medical intervention when it is actually the result of a combination of factors. Clinical trials take steps to rule out factors other than the one being studied, so if those extra factors are actually having an effect on real-world outcomes, the trials are likely to produce conclusions different from those practitioners reach in their real-world observations. In other words, clinical trials may fail to corroborate practitioners\u2019 conclusions.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because it wouldn\u2019t make sense to say that the results of clinical trials could 'circumvent,' or find a way around or bypass, conclusions practitioners reach in real-world scenarios with patients; it\u2019s possible that researchers conducting the trials might avoid engaging with practitioners\u2019 conclusions, but findings from a study can\u2019t choose to get around something. Choice C is incorrect because it wouldn\u2019t make sense to say that the results of clinical trials could 'disseminate,' or spread widely, conclusions practitioners reach in real-world scenarios with patients; the researchers conducting the trials might choose to draw attention to practitioners\u2019 conclusions, but findings from a study can\u2019t spread anything. Choice D is incorrect because it wouldn\u2019t make sense to say that the results of clinical trials could 'implement,' or put into effect, conclusions practitioners reach in real-world scenarios with patients; the researchers conducting the trials might consider practitioners\u2019 conclusions, but findings from a study can\u2019t put anything into effect."

They are much less confident, however, about when this will happen, since that depends on internal characteristics of Betelgeuse that are largely unknown. Astrophysicist Sarafina El-Badry Nance and colleagues recently investigated whether acoustic waves in the star could be used to determine internal stellar states but concluded that this method could not sufficiently reveal Betelgeuse\u2019s internal characteristics to allow its evolutionary state to be firmly fixed.\n\nWhich choice best describes the function of the second sentence in the overall structure of the text?",

The first sentence establishes something astronomers believe with some certainty: that Betelgeuse will explode in a supernova. The second sentence then introduces a problem: astronomers aren\u2019t certain when Betelgeuse will explode because they don\u2019t have enough information about the star\u2019s internal characteristics. Finally, the third sentence indicates that researcher Sarafina El-Badry Nance and colleagues investigated a possible method of obtaining the necessary information about Betelgeuse\u2019s internal characteristics, though they found that the method wouldn\u2019t be sufficient. Thus, the function of the second sentence is to identify the problem that Nance and colleagues attempted to solve but didn\u2019t.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the second sentence introduces the general problem Nance and colleagues hoped to solve, not a serious limitation of how Nance and colleagues tried to solve it. It is the third sentence that introduces Nance and colleagues, but no serious limitation of their approach to studying a method of determining internal stellar states is described. Choice B is incorrect because the second sentence introduces the general problem Nance and colleagues hoped to solve, not the central finding they ultimately reported. It is the third sentence that presents Nance and colleagues\u2019 conclusion that a potential method for determining internal stellar states would be insufficient. Choice D is incorrect because the second sentence doesn\u2019t indicate how other astronomers or astrophysicists responded to the work done by Nance and colleagues; the text doesn\u2019t address this information at all."

In other words, as Drowne continued to carve, the wooden object came to possess, or acquired, greater precision, changing from an indistinct outline or shape into a graceful, beautiful, and clearly recognizable form.\n\nChoice B is incorrect. Although in some contexts \u201cassumed\u201d can mean acknowledged, or recognized, it doesn\u2019t have that meaning in this context because an inanimate object like the wooden figure can\u2019t acknowledge its own precision.

Sykes felt Fletcher\u2019s contributions to the play were obvious\u2014Fletcher had a distinct style in his other plays, so much so that lines with that style were considered sufficient evidence of Fletcher\u2019s authorship. But for the lines not deemed to be by Fletcher, Sykes felt that their depiction of women indicated that their author was not Shakespeare but Philip Massinger.\n\n### Text 2\nScholars have accepted *The Two Noble Kinsmen* as coauthored by Shakespeare since the 1970s: it appears in all major one-volume editions of Shakespeare\u2019s complete works. Though scholars disagree about who wrote what exactly, it is generally held that on the basis of style, Shakespeare wrote all of the first act and most of the last, while John Fletcher authored most of the three middle acts.\n\nBased on the texts, both Sykes in Text 1 and the scholars in Text 2 would most likely agree with which statement?",

The text indicates that by doing so, she eased these women\u2019s transition as their circumstances changed.\n\nChoice B is incorrect.

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "rationale": "Choice B is the best answer because it most accurately describes the function of the underlined sentence in the text as a whole. The text discusses the Bayeux Tapestry, making the point that the workers who produced the huge tapestry in the eleventh century might not have ever produced a tapestry so large before. The text goes on to suggest that because of this lack of previous experience, the workers developed and refined the process of joining the tapestry\u2019s panels over time as they worked. The last sentence of the text then provides an example of an observation that suggests the workers\u2019 process changed: clear misalignment of the borders of the two panels the workers joined first and virtually invisible joins completed later. Thus, the underlined sentence serves to support an argument about the workers who produced the tapestry.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the example given in the last sentence of the text has to do with how the panels of the Bayeux Tapestry were joined by the workers, not with what is depicted in those panels; the text never identifies any people or places depicted in the tapestry. Choice C is incorrect because the last sentence compares how early panels in the Bayeux Tapestry were joined with how later panels in the same tapestry were joined; it doesn\u2019t make any comparison between the Bayeux Tapestry and other tapestries from the same time in France. Choice D is incorrect because the last sentence doesn\u2019t address the location where the Bayeux Tapestry was created; the first sentence of the text presents it as a given that the tapestry was created in France, but nothing in the text indicates how that origin was determined."

The text explains that Mr. Brooke has a \u201ctoo rambling habit of mind,\u201d which the text likens to a disease, saying he is thought to have contracted it. To contract a disease means to acquire or develop a disease. In other words, the text indicates that Mr. Brooke is believed to have acquired, or developed, the habit of mind described in the text.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. Although \u201ccontracted\u201d can mean limited or restricted in some contexts, here Mr. Brooke is said to draw unpredictable conclusions, suggesting that he exhibits this \u201ctoo rambling habit of mind,\u201d not that it has been somehow limited or restricted. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text describes Mr. Brooke\u2019s habit of mind, nothing suggests that those are his descriptions or, indeed, that he described his habit of mind at all.

      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "rationale": "Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of historical evidence about ancient Egypt under the reign of the pharaoh Hatshepsut. In this context, 'an exhaustive' account would be a thorough one. The text states that much of the evidence from her reign was purposely destroyed\u2014in other words, there is a lack of surviving records. This context conveys that unless there are major new archaeological discoveries, an exhaustive account of Hatshepsut\u2019s reign is unlikely.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because in this context, 'an imaginative' account would be an account based on imagination, or ideas and speculation, rather than facts. The text indicates that much of the evidence of Hatshepsut\u2019s reign was deliberately destroyed, and a lack of evidence actually makes it more likely that accounts will be imaginative to some degree and not strictly factual. Choice B is incorrect because in this context, 'a superficial' account would be one that is lacking in depth or concerned only with what is obvious. The text indicates that most evidence of Hatshepsut\u2019s reign was purposely destroyed, which suggests that accounts of that time are likely already somewhat superficial, since there is little information available to support deeper knowledge. Further, it would be illogical to suggest that discovering major new evidence would make it more likely that accounts would be superficial. Choice D is incorrect because 'a questionable' account would be one likely to be challenged or doubted, and since the text suggests that little evidence of Hatshepsut\u2019s reign has survived, accounts of that time probably involve some speculation and thus may already be open to doubt. Further, it would be illogical to suggest that discovering major new evidence would make it more likely that accounts would be questionable."

      "rationale": "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the discussion of Octavia Butler\u2019s career. In this context, \u201cimpenetrable\u201d means impossible to enter. The text indicates that the field of science fiction was dominated by white males when Butler, a Black woman, started writing, but she published several science fiction short stories and a novel and later won a prestigious award; that is, Butler pursued science fiction writing and had success. This context suggests that Butler didn\u2019t view the genre as impossible to enter.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. In this context, \u201clegitimate\u201d would mean genuinely good or valid. Nothing in the text suggests that Butler didn\u2019t think the science fiction genre was good or valid; in fact, it indicates that she pursued and made a successful career of publishing work in that field.

The text indicates that Butler chose to write science fiction, so it wouldn\u2019t make sense to say that she didn\u2019t see the field as drawing her attention. Choice D is incorrect.

      "question": "### Text 1\nGrowth in the use of novel nanohybrids\u2014materials created from the conjugation of multiple distinct nanomaterials, such as iron oxide and gold nanomaterials conjugated for use in magnetic imaging\u2014has outpaced studies of nanohybrids\u2019 environmental risks. Unfortunately, risk evaluations based on nanohybrids\u2019 constituents are not reliable: conjugation may alter constituents\u2019 physiochemical properties such that innocuous nanomaterials form a nanohybrid that is anything but.\n\n### Text 2\nThe potential for enhanced toxicity of nanohybrids relative to the toxicity of constituent nanomaterials has drawn deserved attention, but the effects of nanomaterial conjugation vary by case. For instance, it was recently shown that a nanohybrid of silicon dioxide and zinc oxide preserved the desired optical transparency of zinc oxide nanoparticles while mitigating the nanoparticles\u2019 potential to damage DNA.\n\nBased on the texts, how would the author of Text 2 most likely respond to the assertion in the underlined portion of Text 1?",
      "answers": [
        "A. By concurring that the risk described in Text 1 should be evaluated but emphasizing that the risk is more than offset by the potential benefits of nanomaterial conjugation",
        "B. By arguing that the situation described in Text 1 may not be representative but conceding that the effects of nanomaterial conjugation are harder to predict than researchers had expected",
        "C. By denying that the circumstance described in Text 1 is likely to occur but acknowledging that many aspects of nanomaterial conjugation are still poorly understood",
        "D. By agreeing that the possibility described in Text 1 is a cause for concern but pointing out that nanomaterial conjugation does not inevitably produce that result"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "rationale": "Choice D is the best answer. The author of Text 2 acknowledges that nanohybrids may be more toxic than their constituent parts, but also provides an example of a nanohybrid that has reduced toxicity compared to its components: silicon dioxide and zinc oxide together have all the benefits of zinc oxide nanoparticles without any of the DNA harm zinc oxide has on its own.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. While the author of Text 2 gives an example of a nanohybrid that isn\u2019t as toxic as its constituent parts, they don\u2019t argue that the benefit outweighs the risk. They merely argue that \u201cthe effects of nanomaterial conjugation vary by case.\u201d Choice B is incorrect. The author of Text 2 states that the effects of nanomaterial conjugation \u201cvary by case,\u201d and that the attention that their potential toxicity has drawn is warranted. If the situation in Text 1 weren\u2019t representative, then there would be less attention to the potential danger of these materials. Furthermore, neither passage suggests that researchers had expected that they could predict the effects of nanomaterial conjugation. Choice C is incorrect. The author of Text 2 agrees that the potential toxicity of nanohybrids \u201chas drawn deserved attention,\u201d so they aren\u2019t denying the problem."

The text begins by expressing the speaker\u2019s strong desire to be on the ocean, appealing directly to the waves to rock the speaker to sleep. The poem then describes the 'slumberous lullaby' formed by the sound of the waves and the winds on which the speaker wishes to be carried 'gently...between a peaceful sea and sky.' All these details serve to emphasize the speaker\u2019s desire for the ocean to give them a sense of inner tranquility.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. Given the poem\u2019s expression of a longing to achieve tranquility by drifting on the ocean, it can be inferred that the speaker desires to escape something unpleasant in daily life. However, the poem doesn\u2019t refer directly to any such hardship\u2014ongoing or otherwise. And since the poem doesn\u2019t establish that the speaker is experiencing a desire to escape ongoing hardship, it can\u2019t be said that such a desire increases in intensity. Choice B is incorrect. The speaker does express a desire for the serenity of being rocked to sleep by the ocean, and it can be inferred that this desire is a response to demands that make the speaker\u2019s daily life stressful. However, the poem doesn\u2019t refer directly to such demands or contrast them with the tranquility of drifting on the ocean. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t suggest the speaker has any qualms, or reservations, about being transported by the ocean. On the contrary, the speaker actively desires to 'drift far out' and be carried by the waves and wind. Moreover, the poem doesn\u2019t suggest that this drifting would have any particular destination."

      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "rationale": "Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately describes how the first sentence functions in the text as a whole. The first sentence introduces what yawn contagion is, explaining that it occurs when an individual yawns in response to the yawn of another individual. The text goes on to describe Elisabetta Palagi and her colleagues\u2019 study of this phenomenon in a wild population of gelada monkeys. According to the text, the study showed that wild primate populations experience yawn contagion and that the behavior occurs most commonly in male monkeys and across social groups. Thus, the function of the first sentence is to define the phenomenon of yawn contagion that is discussed in the text.\n\nChoice B is incorrect. Although the first sentence introduces the text\u2019s discussion of yawn contagion, it doesn\u2019t present this behavior, or anything else, as a problem. Choice C is incorrect because the first sentence doesn\u2019t present a claim but instead explains what yawn contagion is. Moreover, the text doesn\u2019t challenge anything; it\u2019s an informative text that describes the findings of a research study about yawning in wild primate populations. Choice D is incorrect. Although the text describes a scientific study, and most scientific studies are guided by a hypothesis, the text doesn\u2019t say what Palagi and her colleagues\u2019 hypothesis was; the text discusses their findings instead."

      "rationale": "Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of self-control in cuttlefish. In this context, 'competent' means capable. The text describes a study in which cuttlefish demonstrated an ability to exercise restraint by waiting for a favorite treat instead of eating a meal that was already available to them. That is, by delaying gratification, the cuttlefish in the study demonstrated that they were capable of, or competent at, exercising self-control.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that in demonstrating self-control, cuttlefish are 'awkward,' or lacking skill or grace. If anything, the text indicates that cuttlefish appear to be surprisingly skilled at exercising self-control. Choice B is incorrect because in this context, 'imaginative' would mean creative, and there's nothing in the text to suggest that cuttlefish demonstrate creativity. Instead, the text focuses on the fact that cuttlefish seem to be capable of exercising restraint and self-control. Choice C is incorrect because in this context, 'manageable' would mean capable of being controlled. Although the text indicates that the cuttlefish in the study demonstrated restraint by waiting for a favorite treat instead of devouring a readily available meal (which suggests their ability to control themselves), it doesn't suggest that cuttlefish are thus also able to be managed or controlled by others."

In this context, \u201cmediated by\u201d means influenced or affected by something. The text establishes that increasing household spending power (an economic factor) produced \u201cmixed effects\u201d on mobility decisions. The text then explains that residential choices are \u201cnot fully reducible to economic factors,\u201d which means that these decisions don\u2019t simply rely on how much money is available to spend on a residential move but on other factors as well. According to the text, noneconomic considerations, such as access to social networks, also play a significant role. Thus, \u201cmediated by\u201d accurately captures this relationship where noneconomic factors influence what might otherwise be purely economic decisions.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because \u201ctransposed with\u201d would suggest that economic and noneconomic factors are being switched or interchanged when making residential mobility decisions, which wouldn\u2019t make logical sense in this context. The text indicates that these factors coexist and jointly influence such decisions. Choice C is incorrect. The phrase \u201cdecoupled from\u201d means separated or disconnected from, which would suggest that economic factors are completely separate from noneconomic factors. This would contradict the text\u2019s main point that residential mobility decisions involve multiple factors being considered simultaneously rather than in isolation. Choice D is incorrect because \u201cantecedent to,\u201d which means something prior or earlier, would indicate that noneconomic factors come before economic ones in time or sequence. The text doesn\u2019t establish this chronological relationship.

Umami\u2014one of the five basic tastes along with sweet, bitter, salty, and sour\u2014was formally classified when its taste receptors were discovered in the 2000s. In 2007, to define the pure umami flavor scientists Rie Ishii and Michael O\u2019Mahony used broths made from shiitake mushrooms and kombu seaweed, and two panels of Japanese and US judges closely agreed on a description of the taste.\n\n### Text 2\nA 2022 experiment by Manon J\u00fcnger et al. led to a greater understanding of soy sauce's flavor profile. The team initially presented a mixture of compounds with low molecular weights to taste testers who found it was not as salty or bitter as real soy sauce. Further analysis of soy sauce identified proteins, including dipeptides, that enhanced umami flavor and also contributed to saltiness. The team then made a mix of 50 chemical compounds that re-created soy sauce's flavor.\n\nBased on the texts, if Ishii and O\u2019Mahony (Text 1) and J\u00fcnger et al.

That\u2019s why Noah Fierer and colleagues were surprised when soil samples they collected from an extremely cold, dry area in Antarctica didn\u2019t seem to contain any life. The finding doesn\u2019t prove that there are no microbes in that area, but the team says it does suggest that the environment severely restricts microbes\u2019 survival.\n\n### Text 2\nMicrobes are found in virtually every environment on Earth. So it\u2019s unlikely they would be completely absent from Fierer\u2019s team\u2019s study site, no matter how extreme the environment is. There were probably so few organisms in the samples that current technology couldn\u2019t detect them. But since a spoonful of typical soil elsewhere might contain billions of microbes, the presence of so few in the Antarctic soil samples would show how challenging the conditions are.\n\nBased on the texts, Fierer\u2019s team and the author of Text 2 would most likely agree with which statement about microbes?",

        "D. Most microbes are probably unable to withstand the soil conditions at the Antarctic study site."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "rationale": "Choice D is the best answer because it presents a statement about microbes with which Fierer\u2019s team (Text 1) and the author of Text 2 would most likely agree. Text 1 states that microbes usually thrive in very harsh conditions, and so Fierer\u2019s team was surprised when samples collected from an extremely cold and dry area of Antarctica didn\u2019t appear to contain any life. Fierer\u2019s team says that though this doesn\u2019t conclusively prove there are no microbes in the area, it suggests that microbes would have a notably difficult time surviving in the environment. The author of Text 2 says it\u2019s unlikely that there would be no microbes at all in the Antarctic study site from which Fierer\u2019s team retrieved soil samples and that there may have been hard-to-detect microbes in the samples. However, the presence of only a few microbes in the Antarctic samples rather than the billions found in a typical soil sample (which would presumably be much easier to detect) would illustrate conditions in the Antarctic soil that make it difficult for microbes to thrive. Since Fierer\u2019s team says that the seeming absence of microbes in the Antarctic samples suggests an unusually harsh environment and the author of Text 2 says that even if there are a few undetectable microbes in the samples, the relatively tiny number of microbes would also suggest an unusually harsh environment, then Fierer\u2019s team and the author of Text 2 would most likely agree that most microbes are unable to withstand the soil conditions at the Antarctic study site.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. The samples taken by Fierer\u2019s team were from an area of Antarctica that is described in part as extremely dry, and these samples didn\u2019t appear to have any life. Therefore, even though these samples also came from an extremely cold area, Fierer\u2019s team wouldn\u2019t argue based on the evidence available that microbes were better able to survive in dry conditions than in areas with harsh temperatures. Moreover, the author of Text 2 says that microbes are found in virtually every environment on Earth but doesn\u2019t compare dry environments and harsh environments. Choice B is incorrect. Nothing in Text 1 indicates that another collection of samples from the Antarctic study site might yield different results from the samples already taken by Fierer\u2019s team. The author of Text 2 does state that microbes are found in virtually every environment on Earth and suggests that new technology may be better able to detect so few microbes in a soil sample, but the author of Text 2 concludes that the unusual absence of microbes in the Antarctic samples is evidence of the harsh Antarctic environment. Therefore, there is no reason to believe that the author of Text 2 thinks that another sample drawn from that same harsh environment would yield a much higher number of microbes. Choice C is incorrect. The author of Text 2 does speculate that there may have been so few microbes in the Antarctic samples that current technology couldn\u2019t detect them, but the author doesn\u2019t speculate that this is due to the size of the microbes. Moreover, nothing that Fierer\u2019s team says suggests that they are speculating that their samples might have microbes that are smaller than microbes in typical soil samples."

        "A. As unexpected, because it was widely believed at the time that white dwarf exoplanets lack continental crusts",
        "B. As premature, because researchers have only just begun trying to determine what kinds of crusts white dwarf exoplanets had",
        "C. As questionable, because it rests on an incomplete consideration of potential sources of the elements detected in white dwarf atmospheres",
        "D. As puzzling, because it\u2019s unusual to successfully detect lithium and sodium when analyzing wavelengths of light in white dwarf atmospheres"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "rationale": "Choice C is the best answer because it reflects how Putirka and Xu (Text 2) would likely characterize the conclusion presented in Text 1. Text 1 discusses a study by Mark Holland and colleagues in which they detected traces of lithium and sodium in the atmospheres of four white dwarf stars. The team claims that this supports the idea that exoplanets with continental crusts like Earth\u2019s once orbited these stars. Text 2 introduces Putirka and Xu, who indicate that sodium and lithium are present in several different minerals and that some of those minerals might exist in types of rock that are not found on Earth. Therefore, Putirka and Xu would likely describe the conclusion in Text 1 as questionable because it does not consider that lithium and sodium are also found in rocks that are not like Earth\u2019s continental crust.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the texts do not indicate how widely held any of the viewpoints described are. Choice B is incorrect because neither text discusses how new this area of study is. Choice D is incorrect because neither text discusses how likely lithium and sodium are to be detected by analyzing wavelengths of light."

      "question": "The following text is from Joseph Conrad\u2019s 1907 novel *The Secret Agent: A Simple Tale*. Mr. Verloc is navigating the London streets on his way to a meeting.\nBefore reaching Knightsbridge, Mr. Verloc took a turn to the left out of the busy main thoroughfare, uproarious with the traffic of swaying omnibuses and trotting vans, in the almost silent, swift flow of hansoms [horse-drawn carriages]. Under his hat, worn with a slight backward tilt, his hair had been carefully brushed into respectful sleekness; for his business was with an Embassy. And Mr. Verloc, steady like a rock\u2014a soft kind of rock\u2014marched now along a street which could with every propriety be described as private.\n\nWhich choice best describes the function of the underlined phrase in the text as a whole?",
      "answers": [
        "A. It qualifies an earlier description of Mr. Verloc.",
        "B. It emphasizes an internal struggle Mr. Verloc experiences.",
        "C. It contrasts Mr. Verloc with his surroundings.",
        "D. It reveals a private opinion Mr. Verloc holds."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "rationale": "Choice A is the best answer. The underline phrase qualifies (meaning adds limits or conditions to) the description of Mr. Verloc as \u201csteady like a rock,\u201d adding that he is a \u201csoft\u201d rock.\n\nChoice B is incorrect. In fact, the passage never mentions Mr. Verloc experiencing any internal struggles. Choice C is incorrect. The underlined phrase doesn\u2019t contrast Mr. Verloc with his surroundings, but is instead modifying the description of him as a rock. Choice D is incorrect. The underlined phrase doesn\u2019t reveal a private opinion Mr. Verloc holds: instead, it further describes his character for the reader."

'Transcending' means 'going beyond,' so 'transcending traditional boundaries' would mean crossing into all those various fields of research, which is exactly the meaning we want.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. This isn\u2019t a logical word choice. Based on the text, we\u2019re looking for a word that means something similar to 'mak[ing] use of insights and techniques from all those fields.' To 'epitomize' means to 'be a perfect example of,' so 'epitomizing traditional boundaries' would mean the opposite of what we want: keeping the fields of research separate. Choice C is incorrect.
