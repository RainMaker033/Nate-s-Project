      "question": "Marta Coll and colleagues’ 2010 Mediterranean Sea biodiversity census reported approximately 17,000 species, nearly double the number reported in Carlo Bianchi and Carla Morri’s 2000 census—a difference only partly attributable to the description of new invertebrate species in the interim. Another factor is that the morphological variability of microorganisms is poorly understood compared to that of vertebrates, invertebrates, plants, and algae, creating uncertainty about how to evaluate microorganisms as species. Researchers’ decisions on such matters therefore can be highly consequential. Indeed, the two censuses reported similar counts of vertebrate, plant, and algal species, suggesting that ______.\nWhich choice most logically completes the text?",
      "answers": [
        "A. Coll and colleagues reported a much higher number of species than Bianchi and Morri did largely due to the inclusion of invertebrate species that had not been described at the time of Bianchi and Morri's census.",
        "B. some differences observed in microorganisms may have been treated as variations within species by Bianchi and Morri but treated as indicative of distinct species by Coll and colleagues.",
        "C. Bianchi and Morri may have been less sensitive to the degree of morphological variation displayed within a typical species of microorganisms than Coll and colleagues were.",
        "D. the absence of clarity regarding how to differentiate among species of microorganisms may have resulted in Coll and colleagues underestimating the number of microorganisms species."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "rationale": "Choice B is the best answer because it presents the conclusion that most logically completes the text's discussion of the different counts of species in the Mediterranean Sea. The text states that Coll and colleagues reported almost double the number of species that Bianchi and Morri reported in their study ten years earlier. According to the text, this difference can only be partly attributed to new invertebrate species being described in the years between the two studies, which means there must be an additional factor that made Coll and colleagues' count so much higher than Bianchi and Morri's count. The text goes on to explain that factor: researchers have a relatively poor understanding of microorganisms' morphological variability, or the differences in microorganisms' structure and form. This poor understanding makes it hard to classify microorganisms by species and means that researchers' decisions about classifying microorganisms can have a large effect on the overall species counts that researchers report. Additionally, the text says that the two censuses reported similar numbers of vertebrate, plant, and algal species, which means that the difference in overall species did not come from differences in those categories. Given all this information, it most logically follows that Coll and colleagues may have treated some of the differences among microorganisms as indicative of the microorganisms being different species, whereas Bianchi and Morri treated those differences as variations within species, resulting in Coll and colleagues reporting many more species than Bianchi and Morri did."

      "question": "A common assumption among art historians is that the invention of photography in the mid-nineteenth century displaced the painted portrait in the public consciousness. The diminishing popularity of the portrait miniature, which coincided with the rise of photography, seems to support this claim. However, photography's impact on the portrait miniature may be overstated. Although records from art exhibitions in the Netherlands from 1820 to 1892 show a decrease in the number of both full-sized and miniature portraits submitted, this trend was established before the invention of photography.\nBased on the text, what can be concluded about the diminishing popularity of the portrait miniature in the nineteenth century?",
      "answers": [
        "A. Factors other than the rise of photography may be more directly responsible for the portrait miniature's decline.",
        "B. Although portrait miniatures became less common than photographs, they were widely regarded as having more artistic merit.",
        "C. The popularity of the portrait miniature likely persisted for longer than art historians have assumed.",
        "D. As demand for portrait miniatures decreased, portrait artists likely shifted their creative focus to photography."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "rationale": "Choice A is the best answer. The text says that the impact of photography on the portrait miniature might be \"overstated,\" as some records show a decrease in the number of portrait miniatures *before* the invention of photography. From this, we can conclude that factors *other* than the rise of photography may be more directly responsible for the portrait miniature's decline."

      "question": "Believing that living in an impractical space can heighten awareness and even improve health, conceptual artists Madeline Gins and Shusaku Arakawa designed an apartment building in Japan to be more fanciful than functional. A kitchen counter is chest-high on one side and knee-high on the other; a ceiling has a door to nowhere. The effect is disorienting but invigorating: after four years there, filmmaker Nobu Yamaoka reported significant health benefits.\nWhich choice best states the main idea of the text?",
      "answers": [
        "A. Although inhabiting a home surrounded by fanciful features such as those designed by Gins and Arakawa can be rejuvenating, it is unsustainable.",
        "B. Designing disorienting spaces like those in the Gins and Arakawa building is the most effective way to create a physically stimulating environment.",
        "C. As a filmmaker, Yamaoka has long supported the designs of conceptual artists such as Gins and Arakawa.",
        "D. Although impractical, the design of the apartment building by Gins and Arakawa may improve the well-being of the building's residents."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "rationale": "Choice D is the best answer because it most accurately states the main idea of the text. According to the text, conceptual artists Gins and Arakawa have designed an apartment building that is disorienting because of several unconventional elements, such as uneven kitchen counters and \"a door to nowhere.\" The text goes on to suggest that there may be benefits to this kind of design because filmmaker Yamaoka lived in the apartment building for four years and reported health benefits. Thus, although the design is impractical, it may improve the well-being of the apartment building's residents."

      "question": "In her 2021 article \"Throwaway History: Towards a Historiography of Ephemera,\" scholar Anne Garner discusses John Johnson (1882–1956), a devoted collector of items intended to be discarded, including bus tickets and campaign pamphlets. Johnson recognized that scholarly institutions considered his expansive collection of ephemera to be worthless—indeed, it wasn't until 1968, after Johnson's death, that Oxford University's Bodleian Library acquired the collection, having grasped the items' potential value to historians and other researchers. Hence, the example of Johnson serves to ______.\nWhich choice most logically completes the text?",
      "answers": [
        "A. demonstrate the difficulties faced by contemporary historians in conducting research at the Bodleian Library without access to ephemera.",
        "B. represent the challenge of incorporating examples of ephemera into the collections of libraries and other scholarly institutions.",
        "C. lend support to arguments by historians and other researchers who continue to assert that ephemera holds no value for scholars.",
        "D. illustrate both the relatively low scholarly regard in which ephemera was once held and the later recognition of ephemera's possible utility."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "rationale": "Choice D is the best answer. Johnson collected \"ephemera,\" or things that are meant to be thrown away. Scholars thought his collection was worthless to them, then later realized that it was potentially valuable. This suggests that scholars went from disregarding ephemera to recognizing their usefulness."

      "question": "One recognized social norm of gift giving is that the time spent obtaining a gift will be viewed as a reflection of the gift's thoughtfulness. Marketing experts Farnoush Reshadi, Julian Givi, and Gopal Das addressed this view in their studies of norms specifically surrounding the giving of gift cards, noting that while recipients tend to view digital gift cards (which can be purchased online from anywhere and often can be redeemed online as well) as superior to physical gift cards (which sometimes must be purchased in person and may only be redeemable in person) in terms of usage, 94.8 percent of participants surveyed indicated that it is more socially acceptable to give a physical gift card to a recipient. This finding suggests that ______.\nWhich choice most logically completes the text?",
      "answers": [
        "A. gift givers likely overestimate the amount of effort required to use digital gift cards and thus mistakenly assume gift recipients will view them as less desirable than physical gift cards.",
        "B. physical gift cards are likely preferred by gift recipients because the tangible nature of those cards offers a greater psychological sense of ownership than digital gift cards do.",
        "C. physical gift cards are likely less desirable to gift recipients than digital gift cards are because of the perception that physical gift cards require unnecessary effort to obtain.",
        "D. gift givers likely perceive digital gift cards as requiring relatively low effort to obtain and thus wrongly assume gift recipients will appreciate them less than they do physical gift cards."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "rationale": "Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of perceptions of digital versus physical gift cards. The text begins by explaining that the perception of \"the time spent obtaining a gift...as a reflection of the gift's thoughtfulness\" is a social norm of gift giving. The text then explains that although those who receive digital gift cards view them as easier to use than physical gift cards, a marketing study nonetheless showed that 94.8% of participants found physical gift cards more \"socially acceptable\" to give. The text specifically contrasts the ease with which digital gift cards \"can be purchased online from anywhere\" with the fact that physical gift cards \"sometimes must be purchased in person\"—suggesting the greater difficulty of obtaining physical cards. Given the text's initial premise that gift-giving norms equate the thoughtfulness of a gift with the effort involved in acquiring that gift, it is reasonable to infer that people perceive digital gift cards as requiring less effort to obtain and thus assume recipients will appreciate them less, even though recipients actually prefer gift cards in the more usable digital format."

      "question": "Municipalities' Responses to Inquiries about Potential Incentives for Firm\n(Note: Graph description: Two sets of bars for \"announcement before election\" and \"announcement after election.\" Each set has three bars: \"no response,\" \"responded to inquiry,\" and \"offered incentive.\" The values for each are similar between the two announcement timing conditions.)\nIn the United States, firms often seek incentives from municipal governments to expand to those municipalities. A team of political scientists hypothesized that municipalities are much more likely to respond to firms and offer incentives if expansions can be announced in time to benefit local elected officials than if they can't. The team contacted officials in thousands of municipalities, inquiring about incentives for a firm looking to expand and indicating that the firm would announce its expansion on a date either just before or just after the next election.\nWhich choice best describes data from the graph that weaken the team's hypothesis?",
      "answers": [
        "A. A large majority of the municipalities that received an inquiry mentioning plans for an announcement before the next election didn't respond to the inquiry.",
        "B. The proportion of municipalities that responded to the inquiry or offered incentives didn't substantially differ across the announcement timing conditions.",
        "C. Only around half the municipalities that responded to inquiries mentioning plans for an announcement before the next election offered incentives.",
        "D. Of the municipalities that received an inquiry mentioning plans for an announcement date after the next election, more than 1,200 didn't respond and only around 100 offered incentives."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "rationale": "Choice B is the best answer. The lighter bars show what happened when the announcement was to come before the election, and the darker bars show what happened when the announcement was to come after the election. For all three of the outcomes, the light and dark bars are virtually the same, demonstrating that the announcement timing didn't actually make a difference."

      "question": "The most recent iteration of the immersive theater experience *Sleep No More*, which premiered in New York City in 2011, transforms its performance space—a five-story warehouse—into a 1930s-era hotel. Audience members, who wander through the labyrinthine venue at their own pace and follow the actors as they play out simultaneous, interweaving narrative loops, confront the impossibility of experiencing the production in its entirety. The play's refusal of narrative coherence thus hinges on the sense of spatial fragmentation that the venue's immense and intricate layout generates.\nWhat does the text most strongly suggest about *Sleep No More*'s use of its performance space?",
      "answers": [
        "A. The choice of a New York City venue likely enabled the play's creators to experiment with the use of theatrical space in a way that venues from earlier productions could not.",
        "B. Audience members likely find the experience of the play disappointing because they generally cannot make their way through the entire venue.",
        "C. The production's dependence on a particular performance environment would likely make it difficult to reproduce exactly in a different theatrical space.",
        "D. Audience members who navigate the space according to a recommended itinerary will likely have a better grasp of the play's narrative than audience members who depart from that itinerary."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "rationale": "Choice C is the best answer. The text says that the production's use of its large, winding space has a very specific effect on the audience. Given that the space itself is so important to creating this effect, it would be difficult to reproduce the production in a different space."

      "question": "During the World War II era, some Mexican American women adopted a striking new look called *pachuca* style. They wore altered men's jackets or zoot suits (wide-legged, long-coated suits) and dramatic makeup, and they combed their hair into high, rounded shapes. Some people criticized *pachuca* style, saying it was dangerous and women should dress traditionally. But historians see things differently. They see *pachuca* style as a form of rebellion against the era's rigid social expectations for women. They say that it showed a desire for self-expression and freedom on the part of women who adopted the style.\nAccording to the text, how do historians view *pachuca* style?",
      "answers": [
        "A. They think that *pachuca* style was such a popular trend that it continues to influence fashion in the United States to the present day.",
        "B. They think that *pachuca* style was a way for some Mexican American women to express themselves and resist strict social expectations.",
        "C. They think that *pachuca* style was celebrated because it enabled some Mexican American women to show their support for the United States during World War II.",
        "D. They think that *pachuca* style was similar to other fashion trends that different groups of women adopted in the same period."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "rationale": "Choice B is the best answer because it presents a statement about how historians view *pachuca* style that is supported by the text. The text first describes the distinctive *pachuca* style of dress adopted by some Mexican American women during World War II, saying that some criticized it and asserted that women should dress traditionally. The text then goes on to contrast this position with that of historians, who \"see things differently\": according to these historians, the *pachuca* style showed a wish for freedom and self-expression, and it acted as a kind of rebellion against what society expected of women at the time. Therefore, according to the text, historians think that the *pachuca* style was a way for Mexican women to express themselves and resist strict social expectations."

      "question": "Utah is home to Pando, a colony of about 47,000 quaking aspen trees that all share a single root system. Pando is one of the largest single organisms by mass on Earth, but ecologists are worried that its growth is declining in part because of grazing by animals. The ecologists say that strong fences could prevent deer from eating young trees and help Pando start thriving again.\nAccording to the text, why are ecologists worried about Pando?",
      "answers": [
        "A. It isn't growing at the same rate it used to.",
        "B. It isn't producing young trees anymore.",
        "C. It can't grow into new areas because it is blocked by fences.",
        "D. Its root system can't support many more new trees."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "rationale": "Choice A is the best answer because it presents an explanation that is directly stated in the text for why ecologists are worried about Pando. The text states that Pando is a colony of about 47,000 quaking aspen trees that represents one of the largest organisms on Earth. According to the text, ecologists are worried that Pando's growth is declining, partly because animals are feeding on the trees.

      "question": "Although many transposons, DNA sequences that move within an organism's genome through shuffling or duplication, have become corrupted and inactive over time, those from the long interspersed nuclear elements (LINE) family appear to remain active in the genomes of some species. In humans, they are functionally important within the hippocampus, a brain structure that supports complex cognitive processes. When the results of molecular analysis of two species of octopus—an animal known for its intelligence—were announced in 2022, the confirmation of a LINE transposon in *Octopus vulgaris* and *Octopus bimaculoides* genomes prompted researchers to hypothesize that that transposon family is tied to a species' capacity for advanced cognition.\nWhich finding, if true, would most directly support the researchers' hypothesis?",
      "answers": [
        "A. The LINE transposon in *O. vulgaris* and *O. bimaculoides* genomes is active in an octopus brain structure that functions similarly to the human hippocampus.",
        "B. The human genome contains multiple transposons from the LINE family that are all primarily active in the hippocampus.",
        "C. A consistent number of copies of LINE transposons is present across the genomes of most octopus species, with few known corruptions.",
        "D. *O. vulgaris* and *O. bimaculoides* have smaller brains than humans do relative to body size, but their genomes contain sequences from a wider variety of transposon families."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "rationale": "Choice A is the best answer. The text says that LINE transposons are important in the human hippocampus, which supports complex cognition. If the LINE transposon found in octopuses is active in a similar part of their brain, that would suggest that LINE transposons support complex cognition in octopuses too, which in turn supports the hypothesis that LINE transposons are linked to advanced cognition in general."

      "question": "To understand how temperature change affects microorganism-mediated cycling of soil nutrients in alpine ecosystems, Eva Kaštovská et al. collected plant-soil cores in the Tatra Mountains at elevations around 2,100 meters and transplanted them to elevations of 1,700–1,800 meters, where the mean air temperature was warmer by 2°C. Microorganism-mediated nutrient cycling was accelerated in the transplanted cores; crucially, microorganism community composition was unchanged, allowing Kaštovská et al. to attribute the acceleration to temperature-induced increases in microorganism activity.\nIt can most reasonably be inferred from the text that the finding about the microorganism community composition was important for which reason?",
      "answers": [
        "A. It provided preliminary evidence that microorganism-mediated nutrient cycling was accelerated in the transplanted cores.",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "rationale": "Choice C is the best answer because it accurately describes why the finding about the microorganism community composition was important. The text describes an experiment by Eva Kaštovská and her team in which they collected plant-soil cores at one elevation and transplanted them to sites at a lower elevation, where the mean air temperature was warmer. Kaštovská and her team observed that microorganism-mediated nutrient cycling was accelerated in the transplanted cores and that \"crucially, microorganism community composition was unchanged,\" which allowed the team to attribute the acceleration to changes in microorganism activity brought about by the difference in temperature. This strongly implies that the team wouldn't have been able to make that attribution otherwise, meaning that a change in microorganism composition represented another possible explanation for the acceleration that had to be ruled out."

      "question": "Jean-Bernard Caron and colleagues recently discovered a cache of jellyfish fossils in the Burgess Shale, a site in the Canadian Rockies that is rich in fossils from the Cambrian period (over 500 million years ago). Caron and colleagues claim that these are the oldest jellyfish fossils ever discovered. In the past twenty years, two sites in China and the United States have yielded fossils of a similar age that some experts believe are most likely jellyfish due to their shapes and the appearance of projecting tentacles. But Caron and colleagues argue that the apparent tentacles are in fact the comb rows of ctenophores, gelatinous animals that are only distantly related to jellyfish.\nWhich statement, if true, would most directly weaken the claim by Caron and colleagues about the fossils found in China and the United States?",

In the film *The Godfather Part II*, the *fabula* is the story of the Corleone family, and the *syuzhet* is the presentation of the story as it alternates between two timelines in 1901 and 1958. But literary theorist Mikhail Bakhtin maintained that *fabula* and *syuzhet* are insufficient to completely describe a narrative—he held that systematic categorizations of artistic phenomena discount the subtle way in which meaning is created by interactions between the artist, the work, and the audience.\nWhich choice best states the main idea of the text?",

      "question": "The ancient Greek concept of \"mimesis,\" a term used in the works of Plato, Aristotle, and other Greek philosophers in discussions of representational art—visual, performance, or literary art that aims to depict the real world—is a foundational concept of the Western philosophy of aesthetics. Mimesis is typically translated as \"imitation\" in modern editions of ancient Greek texts, but scholar Stephen Halliwell warns that this is overly reductive: \"imitation\" implies that art merely copies—and is thus by definition entirely derivative of—a reality that exists outside and prior to the work of art, and translating \"mimesis\" thusly obscures the multifaceted ways in which the ancient Greeks understood the relationship between art and reality.\nWhich statement, if true, would most directly support the claim by Halliwell presented in the text?",
      "answers": [
        "A. One of the earliest appearances of mimesis's root word, *mimos*, can be found in an ancient Greek tragedy in reference to dramatic impersonation, and the *mim-* root came to be generally associated with the musical and poetic arts by the fifth century BCE.",
        "B. Both Plato's and Aristotle's theorizations of mimesis examine the psychological effects that works of art induce in the viewer or listener.",
        "C. Although several of Plato's earliest philosophical works discuss aesthetic ideas, the term \"mimesis\" doesn't appear in Plato's discussions of art until *Cratylus*, a relatively late work.",
        "D. Although Plato's writings typically characterize representational art as an inferior reflection of the physical world, Aristotle suggests that mimesis can refer to art's capacity to envision hypothetical conditions that could, but don't yet, exist."

      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "rationale": "Choice D is the best answer because it presents a statement that would support Halliwell's claim that \"imitation\" is an overly simplified translation of the word \"mimesis\" in the context of ancient Greek philosophical discussions of representational art and that, because it suggests a view of art as merely copying things that exist in reality, the translation obscures the fact that Plato, Aristotle, and other ancient Greeks understood the relationship between art and reality in varied ways. If Plato's works tend to treat representational art as an inferior or inadequate reflection of the physical world (consistent with the idea of mere imitation), while Aristotle's works suggest that the term \"mimesis\" can refer to art's ability to show conditions that don't currently exist but could exist (going beyond imitation into novel creation), that evidence would support the claim that the term \"mimesis\" means more than just \"imitation\" and that ancient Greek philosophers held different views of the relationship between art and reality."

General economic policy uncertainty was substantially lower than trade policy uncertainty in 2005 and substantially higher than trade policy uncertainty in 2010.)\nHigh levels of public uncertainty about which economic policies a country will adopt can make planning difficult for businesses, but measures of such uncertainty have not tended to be very detailed.

The graph presents values for economic policy uncertainty in tax and public spending policy, trade policy, and general economic policy in the UK from 2005 to 2010. The graph shows that in 2005, the value for general economic policy uncertainty (approximately 90) was substantially lower than the value for uncertainty about trade policy specifically (approximately 160). It also shows that in 2010, the value for general economic policy uncertainty (approximately 120) was substantially higher than the value for uncertainty about trade policy (approximately 70). The substantial differences between these values in 2005 and 2010 support the claim that a general measure may not fully reflect uncertainty about specific areas of policy."

According to the text, moving at maximal speed (the highest speed possible) requires so much energy that it is not always an effective strategy for animals, even when they are escaping predators. The graph displays data on the average percent of maximal speed used by lizard species while either escaping predators or pursuing prey. The graph categorizes the data for both pursuing and escaping by the number of species using 30%–39% of maximal speed, 40%–49% of maximal speed, 50%–59% of maximal speed, 60%–69% of maximal speed, 70%–79% of maximal speed, 80%–89% of maximal speed, and 90%–100% of maximal speed, respectively. In the graph, there is at least one species in each of the following percent categories for maximal speed while escaping predators: 50%–59%, 60%–69%, 70%–79%, and 80%–89%.

      "question": "Almost all works of fiction contain references to the progression of time, including the time of day when events in a story take place. In a 2020 study, Allen Kim, Charuta Pethe, and Steven Skiena claim that an observable pattern in such references reflects a shift in human behavior prompted by the spread of electric lighting in the late nineteenth century. The researchers drew this conclusion from an analysis of more than 50,000 novels spanning many centuries and cultures, using software to recognize and tally both specific time references—that is, clock phrases, such as 7 a.m. or 2:30 p.m.—and implied ones, such as mentions of meals typically associated with a particular time of day.\nWhich finding from the study, if true, would most directly support the researchers' conclusion?",

If novels published after 1880 contain significantly more references to activities occurring after 10 p.m. than novels from earlier periods do, this would suggest a change in human behavior and daily routines enabled by the availability of electric lighting. Before electric lighting—which provided illumination more easily than other available forms of light—many activities ceased after nightfall, so references to late-night activities would be less common in earlier novels. An increase in such references after 1880 would align with the researchers' conclusion, reflecting an increase in late-night activities made possible by electric lighting."

The researchers claim that endothermy enabled mosasaurs to live in relatively cold waters near the poles. If several mosasaur fossils have been found in areas that were near the poles during the period when mosasaurs were alive and fossils of nonendothermic marine reptiles are rare in such locations, that would support the researchers' claim: it would show that mosasaurs inhabited polar waters but nonendothermic marine mammals tended not to, suggesting that endothermy may have been the characteristic that enabled mosasaurs to include polar waters in their range."

Therefore, businesses should recognize that ______.\nWhich choice most logically completes the text?",
      "answers": [
        "A. the interpersonal benefits of some interruptions in the workplace may offset the perceived negative effects.",
        "B. in order to maximize productivity, employers should be willing to interrupt employees frequently throughout the day.",
        "C. most employees avoid interrupting colleagues because they don't appreciate being interrupted themselves.",
        "D. in order to cultivate an ideal workplace environment, interruptions of work should be discouraged."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "rationale": "Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of potential benefits of interruptions in the workplace. The text indicates that a common belief in business is that interruptions to working employees decrease energy and productivity levels. However, the text goes on to explain that a research team led by Harshad Puranik has found that there could be a social benefit to these interruptions. Since the team found that workplace interruptions can increase employees' sense of belonging and job satisfaction, it follows that the interpersonal benefits of some interruptions can offset the perceived negative effects."

      "question": "In 1534 CE, King Henry VIII of England split with the Catholic Church and declared himself head of the Church of England, in part because Pope Clement VII refused to annul his marriage to Catherine of Aragon. Two years later, Henry VIII introduced a policy titled the Dissolution of the Monasteries that by 1540 had resulted in the closure of all Catholic monasteries in England and the confiscation of their estates. Some historians assert that the enactment of the policy was primarily motivated by perceived financial opportunities.\nWhich quotation from a scholarly article best supports the assertion of the historians mentioned in the text?",
      "answers": [
        "A. \"At the time of the Dissolution of the Monasteries, about 2 percent of the adult male population of England were monks; by 1690, the proportion of the adult male population who were monks was less than 1 percent.\"",
        "B. \"A contemporary description of the Dissolution of the Monasteries, Michael Sherbrook's *Falle of the Religious Howses*, recounts witness testimony that monks were allowed to keep the contents of their cells and that the monastery timber was purchased by local yeomen.\"",
        "C. \"In 1535, the year before enacting the Dissolution of the Monasteries, Henry commissioned a survey of the value of church holdings in England—the work, performed by sheriffs, bishops, and magistrates, began that January and was swiftly completed by the summer.\"",
        "D. \"The October 1536 revolt known as the Pilgrimage of Grace had several economic motives: high food prices due to a poor harvest the prior year; the Dissolution of the Monasteries, which closed reliable sources of food and shelter for many; and rents and taxes throughout Northern England that were not merely high but predatory.\""
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "rationale": "Choice C is the best answer. The fact that Henry VIII commissioned a survey of church holdings just before enacting the Dissolution of the Monasteries suggests that he was interested in the potential profits from claiming their assets. This supports the historians' assertion."

      "question": "Participants' Responses to Three Review Conditions\n(Note: Graph description: Bar graph for three conditions: no anger (control), low anger, high anger. Two bars per condition: \"helpfulness of review\" and \"attitude toward product.\" For helpfulness: low anger slightly higher than control, high anger lower than control. For attitude: both low and high anger slightly lower than control.)\nTo understand how expressions of anger in reviews of products affect readers of those reviews, business scholar Dezhi Yin and colleagues measured study participants' responses to three versions of the same negative review—a control review expressing no anger, a review expressing a high degree of anger, and a review expressing a low degree of anger. Reviewing the data, a student concludes that the mere presence of anger in a review may not negatively affect readers' perceptions of the review, but a high degree of anger in a review does worsen readers' perceptions of the review.\nWhich choice best describes data from the graph that support the students' conclusion?",
      "answers": [
        "A. On average, participants' ratings of the helpfulness of the review were substantially higher than were participants' ratings of the reviewed product regardless of which type of review participants had seen.",
        "B. Compared with participants who saw the control review, participants who saw the low-anger review rated the review as slightly more helpful, whereas participants who saw the high-anger review rated the review as less helpful.",
        "C. Participants who saw the low-anger review rated the review as slightly more helpful than participants who saw the control review did, but participants' attitude toward the reviewed product was slightly worse when participants saw the low-anger review than when they saw the no-anger review.",

The claim is that low anger does not negatively affect readers' perceptions of the review, while high anger does negatively affect readers' perceptions of the review. This choice accurately expresses the supporting data from the \"helpfulness of review\" part of the graph: that low-anger reviews were rated as slightly more helpful than no-anger reviews, while high-anger reviews were rated as less helpful than no-anger reviews."

Clamshells become thin and eroded as they wash up on the beach, while those on the seafloor are smooth and sturdy, so the research team suspects that Neanderthals prized the tools made with seafloor shells. However, the team also concluded that those tools were likely more challenging to obtain, noting that ______.\nWhich choice most effectively uses data from the table to support the research team's conclusion?",
      "answers": [
        "A. at each depth below the surface in the cave, the difference in the numbers of tools of each type suggests that shells were easier to collect from the beach than to harvest from the seafloor.",
        "B. the highest number of tools were at a depth of 3–4 meters below the surface, which suggests that the Neanderthal population at the site was highest during the related period of time.",
        "C. at each depth below the surface in the cave, the difference in the numbers of tools of each type suggests that Neanderthals preferred to use clamshells from the beach because of their durability.",
        "D. the higher number of tools at depths of 5–6 meters below the surface in the cave than at depths of 4–5 meters below the surface suggests that the size of clam populations changed over time."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "rationale": "Choice A is the best answer because it most effectively uses data from the table to support the researchers' conclusion about the harvesting of clamshells by Neanderthals for use as tools. The text explains that Neanderthals used clamshells to make tools and that the sturdiest, and therefore the most desirable, shells for this purpose are found on the seafloor, not on the beach. However, the researchers also concluded that the clamshell tools made from shells from the seafloor are rarer than those made from shells from the beach. Meanwhile the table shows that at each depth, the number of tools made from shells from the beach exceeds the number made from the more desirable shells from the seafloor. The fact that the more desirable shells are less common suggests that it was significantly more difficult to harvest shells from the seafloor than from the beach."

Seal A: ~180% Day 1, ~160% Day 2. Seal B: ~120% Day 1, ~100% Day 2. Seal C: ~110% Day 1, ~100% Day 2.)\nResearch suggests that REM sleep in animals is homeostatically regulated: animals compensate for periods of REM sleep deprivation by increasing subsequent REM sleep. When on land, fur seals get enough REM sleep, but during the weeks they're in the water, they get almost none. In a study of fur seals' sleep habits, researchers recorded the REM sleep (as a percentage of baseline) of fur seals once they had returned to land.

      "correctAnswer": "C",

If REM sleep were homeostatically regulated in fur seals, then all the seals would compensate with REM levels significantly over baseline after going weeks without REM. We'd also expect the seals to maintain those elevated REM levels for some time. Since seals B and C return very quickly to baseline REM levels, this suggests that REM sleep in fur seals may not be regulated homeostatically."
